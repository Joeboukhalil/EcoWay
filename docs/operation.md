# How Beacons Work Together

## Placement
- Place beacons at strategic locations to ensure full coverage.
- Avoid placing beacons too close to each other to minimize signal overlap.

## Communication
- Beacons broadcast signals at regular intervals.
- The receiver device detects these signals and calculates the user’s location based on signal strength.

## Testing
- Test each beacon’s placement and configuration.
- Adjust settings as needed to improve accuracy.
